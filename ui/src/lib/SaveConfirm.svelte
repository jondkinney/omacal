<!--
  Guest-list spec §3, and it is `MoveConfirm`'s panel with a save's words on it
  rather than a third dialog: `ConfirmPanel` exists because a fourth
  near-identical one would drift, and the drag work built it for this.

  The form used to warn "Saving will notify N guests" and pass `all`
  unconditionally. That reasoning was sound while a save was the only way to
  change an event — a time typed on purpose is exactly what guests need to hear
  about. It stopped being sound the moment the form could edit the guest list
  itself: correcting a typo in an address, or marking somebody optional, would
  mail the whole room about a change that concerns one person.
