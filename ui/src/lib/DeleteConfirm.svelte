           rather than how much of it. The middle one in particular deletes
           nothing at all: it patches the series' rule so it stops earlier, which
           is the only way to lose the tail of a series without also losing the
           occurrences before the clicked one — they are all the same Google
           event. See `deleteEvent`'s doc comment in `eventdetail.ts`.

           Deliberately no occurrence count anywhere here: an open-ended rule has
           no last occurrence to count to, and a number that is only right for the
           rules that happen to end is worse than no number in a dialog with no
           undo. -->
