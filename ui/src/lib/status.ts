/**
 * The status light's whole answer: which state, and the sentence that says so.
 *
 * **One call for both, and that is the design rather than a convenience.**
 * Spec §2 requires that a colour is never the only signal, and the way to
 * guarantee it is not to remember to write the words — it is to make the
 * colour and the words the same answer. The component derives its class *and*
 * its `aria-label`/`title` from this one result, so a dot showing one thing
 * while announcing another is not a state this code can reach.
 *
 * The order the facts are read in is the only real decision here, and each
 * step is a case where two things are true at once:
 *
 *   1. **`busy` first.** A sync in flight outranks the failure it is retrying;
 *      otherwise the light stays red through the very moment it is being fixed.
 *   2. **`error` before `lastSyncMs`.** `lastSyncMs` is the last *successful*
 *      sync and survives a failed one, so reading it first reports "Synced
 *      5 min ago" while the calendar quietly goes stale — the exact defect a
 *      status light exists to make visible.
 *   3. **Signed out is not a failure.** Nothing has gone wrong; there is
 *      nothing to sync. A red dot on a fresh install is the app telling a new
 *      user it is broken.
 *
 * `error` is `App`'s own error state, which is wider than sync: a write that
 * could not refresh sets it too, and `AppStatus` carries no sync-specific
 * failure field to narrow to. Keeping the wider signal is deliberate — it is
 * the only failure the header is given, and under-reporting one is worse than
 * occasionally over-reporting.
 *
 * **So the label does not claim it was a sync failure.** Saying "Last sync
 * failed" when a *write* could not refresh states as fact something the source
 * cannot support: over-reporting that a problem exists is defensible,
 * misreporting which problem it is is not. The dot says something is wrong and
 * the sentence says what, by carrying `App`'s own message rather than a
 * category invented here.
 *
 * If it ever proves noisy — a transient write failure leaving the light red
 * until the next operation — that is when a sync-specific field on `AppStatus`
 * earns its cost. Not before.
