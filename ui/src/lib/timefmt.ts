// reads as `13:30` or as `1:30 PM`.
//
// This existed three times before it existed once: `EventBlock`, `Filmstrip`
// and `EventPopover` each carried the same two-line `hhmm`, and the Week and
// Day gutter carried a fourth spelling of the same idea. Three copies of a
// constant are three places to change and two places to forget, which is
// survivable while the constant is `hour12: false` forever and stops being so
// the moment it becomes a preference.
//
// **Built by hand rather than by `Intl`, deliberately.** The old `hhmm` asked
// `toLocaleTimeString` for a fixed 24-hour clock, which works because every
// locale that matters renders that the same way — but the 12-hour side has no
// such luck (`1:30 PM`, `1:30 pm`, `13:30` in a locale that ignores the flag),
// and the *screenshot goldens* would then depend on the ICU data of whichever
// machine rendered them. The testing standard has an open failure of exactly
// that shape already (`ruleInWords`, §6). Two dozen strings are cheaper than a
// second one.
