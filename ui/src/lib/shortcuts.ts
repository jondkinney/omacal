//
// **The table is the binding and the documentation at once**, which is the

// `switch`, and nothing anywhere told the user either existed — a
// keyboard-first calendar whose keyboard was a secret. The obvious fix is a
// help sheet listing the keys; the fix that stays true is a help sheet reading
// the same array the handler dispatches from, so a key added to one cannot go
// missing from the other.
//
// The exhaustiveness is not by convention: `ShortcutId` is derived from this
// array, and `App`'s action map is typed `Record<ShortcutId, () => void>`, so
// an entry added here without a handler is a compile error rather than a line
// in the sheet that does nothing when pressed.
