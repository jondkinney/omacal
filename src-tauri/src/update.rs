//! The update notice — knowing a newer release exists, saying so once — and,
//! on exactly one channel, the button that acts on it.
//!
//! The notice is the foundation and it is universal: an installed copy
//! otherwise runs unchanged forever with no way to learn that a newer
//! version exists, which matters doubly here because a rotated OAuth secret
//! strands old binaries (distribution runbook) and the only cure is the
//! update the user never heard about.
//!
//! Acting on the notice is narrower. The AppImage — the installer
//! one-liner's channel, and most installs — is one user-owned file, so
//! [`install_update`] can replace it in place: a signed download, verified
//! against the pubkey in `tauri.conf.json`, then the same restart the
//! moved-zone banner uses. Every packaged install (.deb, .rpm, AUR,
//! Flatpak) keeps the notice-only banner, because there the files belong to
//! a package manager and the update mechanism is that manager, as the
//! user's own act. [`may_self_update`] is that decision, stated once.
//!
//! Split the way `sync_loop` and `tray` are: the decisions — is a tag newer,
//! does a response announce a notice, may demo check at all, may this build
//! replace itself — are pure and tested; the ticker, the browser-open and
//! the plugin's download-and-install are OS integration and are the
//! untested half.
