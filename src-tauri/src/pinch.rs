//! The touchpad pinch, handed to the page on Linux.
//!
//! On macOS a pinch reaches the page by itself: `WKWebView` never has
//! magnification switched on (wry does not touch `allowsMagnification`),
//! so WebKit forwards each `magnify` event as the DOM's own
//! `gesturestart`/`gesturechange`/`gestureend`, scale and all, and
//! `ui/src/lib/pinch.ts` listens for those. On Linux it never arrives.
//! WebKitGTK attaches its own `GtkGestureZoom` to the view and routes the
//! pinch into `ViewGestureController::setMagnification` — a Safari-style
//! magnification of the whole page, created unconditionally on process
//! launch — and the page sees one zero-delta "began" wheel event and nothing
//! else. It is not turned into Ctrl+wheel (Chromium's convention, which the
//! guard in `App.svelte` was written against), so nothing in JavaScript can
//! see it, let alone stop it (verified in `WebKitWebViewBase.cpp`,
//! 2026-09-03).
//!
//! So the pinch is taken off the widget before WebKit gets it. A
//! `GtkGestureZoom` of our own, on the same widget, in the **capture**
//! phase: GTK runs capture-phase controllers top-down before the target's
//! own handlers and before WebKit's bubble-phase gesture, and a sequence
//! claimed here is denied to every other gesture on the widget. What the
//! gesture reports — cumulative scale since the pinch began, and where the
//! fingers are, in widget coordinates, which are the page's CSS pixels — is
//! emitted to the page as a `pinch` event in the shape `pinch.ts` unifies
//! with the macOS one. The grid decides what a pinch means; this file only
//! delivers it.
