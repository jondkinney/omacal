//! Importing events from an `.ics` file (#67).
//!
//! **Planning is separate from doing, and the plan is the product.** An
//! import is the one operation here that writes many events at once, from a
//! file the app did not write, so the thing that matters is knowing what it
//! will do before it does it: this module reads a file and answers with one
//! [`Planned`] per VEVENT — imported with these fields, or skipped with this
//! reason. The surfaces show that plan (`--dry-run`, and the dialog's
//! preview) and then hand the same plan back to be executed.
//!
//! Three rules decide what is skipped, and all three are the same rule:
//! **never silently alter what the file said.**
//!
//! - A **repeat rule the app cannot express** is not downgraded to a single
//!   event. `write::EventInput` carries the form's vocabulary — daily,
//!   weekdays, weekly, monthly, yearly — rather than an RRULE, deliberately
//!   (see its doc comment), so a rule outside that set has no honest
//!   representation here. Importing the first occurrence and calling it the
//!   series would be a lie about the user's data.
//! - **Guests are never imported.** A create carries its guest list to the
//!   server, and a server invites the people on it. Importing a colleague's
//!   exported year would email everyone they ever met, about meetings that
//!   already happened. The events come in; the guest lists stay out, and the
//!   plan says so per event.
//! - An event whose **UID is already in the database** is skipped, so the
//!   same file imported twice does not double anything.
//!
//! Everything the plan does import goes through `events::create_event_body`,
//! the path the window and the CLI already write through. No second write
//! path, and no raw resource PUT: a lossless CalDAV import would be one, and
//! it would be the only way into the database that none of this repo's
//! guards cover.
